        description: "I worked independently on a Navigation System that required me to implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, data parsing, and the in and out pipe communication to the pygame plotter. I created a C++ class called digraph.cpp and implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the least cost path between two points on the map. Through my implementation of unordered maps and a min heap, my algorithm achieved an efficient time complexity.",
